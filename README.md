## Description
This application is my personal portfolio webpage. Users are able to view information about me, six portfolio entries, a contact form that has input validation, and a résumé page. The footer also features links to my social accounts.

This is a React app written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSX, and is publicly deployed on GitHub Pages.
